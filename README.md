# Simplify Tabs

Simplify Tabs automatically organizes cluttered tabs. Frequently used tabs are moved to the left and unused tabs are closed after a certain period of time. You can also set rules for specific files, such as index.js.

## Features

- The active tabs are automatically left-aligned.
- When the number of tabs exceeds the number of tabs retained, the tabs on the right side are automatically closed.
- Individual rules can be set for file names.

## Installation

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.
